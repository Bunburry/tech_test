# Riverford Data Analytics

### Overview
Riverford has a lot of operational data but the development team think that it could
be made more useful with some interactive visualisations.

We talked about what we would like to achieve and it was felt 
that an interactive graphical single page web application that allows a user to
visualise Riverford product sales data could be used to demo what was possible. This
would be valuable when attempting to pitch the idea to the directors.

The page should allow the user to see in a visual way high level details of Riverford
product sales grouped by category. Clicking on the visualisation should let the user
drill into the categories to see the top 10 products in each category and the units sold
in a visual way.

One of the team started work on the demo page but unfortunately they
called in sick and everyone else is committed to other work.

Some decisions have already been made:

1. The visulations are going to implemented in the browser using JavaScript
1. The chosen library for the visualisations is Chart JS (http://www.chartjs.org/)
1. The demo page has to work on the Google Chrome browser (latest stable)
1. A sample data file in json format was produced that contains source data for the page
1. The page should be hosted in GitHub pages (https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

Can you pick this up and complete the work?

### What you need to do

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't got one already
1. Fork the riverford/tech-test-2018 repository (https://github.com/riverford/tech-test-2018)

    1. A link to your GitHub repository
    1. A link to the GitHub Pages completed demo page 

### Hints
We will be looking at your choice of appropriate visualisations for the data provided,
the accuracy of the websites output, code style and readability. 

### Timeframe
Please return the deliverables within 5 working days. You can spend as long or as
little as you wish on the test, the solution & approach is more interesting to us than
your available free-time. Once received we will review the solution and get back to you
